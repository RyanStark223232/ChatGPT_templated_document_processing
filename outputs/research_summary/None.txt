Point 1
Description: Convolutional Networks (convnets) have shown excellent performance in various visual classification tasks. However, there is still limited understanding of their internal operation and behavior.
Example 1: Convnets achieve record-breaking performance on the ImageNet 2012 classification benchmark, outperforming other models with an error rate of 16.4% compared to 26.1% for the second-place result.
Example 2: Convnet models also demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on NORB and CIFAR-10 datasets.
Point 2
Description: The paper introduces a visualization technique using a deconvnet to gain insights into the function and behavior of intermediate feature layers in convnets.
Example 1: The deconvnet maps feature activities back to the input pixel space, allowing the identification of input patterns that caused specific activations in the feature maps.
Example 2: By attaching a deconvnet to each layer of the convnet and reconstructing the activity from the layer beneath, the authors can analyze the evolution of features during training and diagnose potential issues with the model.
Point 3
Description: The authors explore different convnet architectures and discover ones that outperform previous results on the ImageNet dataset.
Example 1: By starting with the architecture of Krizhevsky et al. (2012), the authors modify and improve it, achieving better classification performance on ImageNet.
Example 2: The generalization ability of the convnet model is tested on other datasets by retraining only the softmax classifier, resulting in convincing performance on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.
Point 4
Description: The paper highlights related work on visualizing features in convnets, focusing on the limitations of existing methods in interpreting activity in higher layers.
Example 1: Previous visualization techniques mainly focus on the first layer where projections to pixel space are possible, but they lack interpretability for higher layers.
Example 2: The proposed visualization approach differs from others by providing top-down projections that reveal structures within each patch, stimulating specific feature maps.
Point 5
Description: The paper outlines the approach used in the experiments, employing standard fully supervised convnet models with convolution, rectified linear functions, max pooling, and local contrast operations.
Example 1: The convnet models map input images to probability vectors representing different classes, utilizing convolutional layers, rectified linear functions, and optional pooling and contrast operations.
Example 2: The final layer of the model consists of a softmax classifier, and the parameters of the network are trained through backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent using a large labeled image dataset.
Point 6
Description: The authors introduce the deconvnet as a tool to visualize and understand the operation of convnets by mapping feature activities back to the input pixel space.
Example 1: The deconvnet, attached to each layer of the convnet, allows the reconstruction of the input pattern that caused a specific activation in the feature maps.
Example 2: The deconvnet performs unpooling, rectification, and filtering operations in reverse to reconstruct the activity from the chosen activation back to the input pixel space.
Point 7
Description: The visualization technique relies on unpooling, rectification, and filtering operations in the deconvnet to reconstruct feature activities from higher layers back to the input pixel space.
Example 1: Unpooling approximates the inverse of max pooling by using switch variables to place reconstructions from the layer above into appropriate locations, preserving the structure of the stimulus.
Example 2: Rectification ensures that the feature reconstructions at each layer are positive by passing the reconstructed signal through a rectified linear function.
Point 8
Description: The deconvnet uses transposed versions of learned filters, applied to rectified feature maps

Summary:
Point 1
Description: The deconvnet layer reconstructs a representation of the convnet features from the layer below. It projects the features down to the pixel space, showing the structures that contribute to the feature activation.
Example 1: The deconvnet layer reconstructs an approximate version of the features in layer 4, highlighting the grass in the background instead of the foreground objects.
Example 2: In layer 5, the deconvnet layer shows entire objects with significant pose variation, such as keyboards and dogs.
Point 2
Description: The training details of the large convnet model used for visualization are explained. The model is trained on the ImageNet dataset with specific preprocessing steps and training parameters.
Example 1: The model is trained on 1.3 million images from the ImageNet dataset, using stochastic gradient descent with a mini-batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 10^-2.
Point 3
Description: The paper describes the visualization of feature activations in the convnet using the deconvnet approach. It shows how the visualizations reveal the hierarchical nature of features and their invariance to input deformations.
Example 1: Visualizations of layer 2 show responses to corners and edge/color conjunctions, while layer 3 captures similar textures and layer 4 shows class-specific features like dog faces and bird's legs.
Example 2: The feature evolution during training demonstrates that lower layers converge quickly, while upper layers develop after more epochs, indicating the need for full convergence.
Point 4
Description: The paper discusses the feature invariance of the convnet and shows how small transformations affect the feature vectors in different layers. It also presents insights into architecture selection based on visualizations.
Example 1: Small transformations have a significant impact on the first layer of the model but less impact on the top feature layer, showing quasi-linear behavior for translation and scaling.
Example 2: By visualizing the first and second layers of the original architecture, problems related to high/low-frequency information and aliasing artifacts are identified, leading to architectural improvements.
Point 5
Description: The paper explores occlusion sensitivity to evaluate whether the model localizes objects within images. It occludes different parts of the input image and observes the classifier's output and feature map activity.
Example 1: Occluding the region that appears in the visualization results in a strong drop in activity in the corresponding feature map, validating the relationship between the visualization and the image structure.
Point 6
Description: Correspondence analysis is discussed as a potential implicit mechanism in deep models for establishing correspondence between object parts. The paper presents an experiment with occluded dog images to measure the consistency of feature vectors.
Example 1: Five randomly drawn dog images with frontal pose are masked to hide the same part of the face. The consistency of the difference vector between related image pairs is measured, indicating potential implicit computation of spatial configurations.
