Summary:
Introduction
Description: Convolutional Networks (convnets) have shown excellent performance in various visual classification tasks. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding their internal operation and behavior.
Example 1: Convolutional networks have achieved remarkable results in tasks like hand-written digit classification and face detection.
Example 2: Convnet models, such as the one proposed by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012, achieved record-breaking performance on the ImageNet classification benchmark.
Approach
Description: The paper utilizes standard fully supervised convnet models. These models consist of convolutional layers, rectified linear functions, max pooling, and local contrast operations. The top layers are fully-connected networks, and the final layer is a softmax classifier.
Example 1: The convnet model processes input images through a series of layers, applying filters, activation functions, and pooling operations.
Example 2: The model is trained using a large set of labeled images, and the parameters are updated via stochastic gradient descent.
Visualization with a Deconvnet
Description: The paper introduces a novel visualization technique using a Deconvolutional Network (deconvnet) to map the activities of intermediate layers back to the input pixel space.
Example 1: By attaching a deconvnet to each layer of the convnet, the authors can reconstruct the input pattern that caused a specific activation in the feature maps.
Example 2: The deconvnet performs unpooling, rectification, and filtering operations to reconstruct the activity in the layer below, ultimately reaching the input pixel space.
Related Work
Description: Previous research has focused on visualizing features, particularly in the first layer, but limited methods exist for interpreting higher layer activities. The paper highlights alternative approaches, such as optimizing stimuli to maximize unit activation and analyzing the Hessian of units.
Example 1: Erhan et al. (2009) used gradient descent to find the optimal stimulus for each unit, while Le et al. (2010) computed the Hessian to understand invariances.
Example 2: Donahue et al. (2013) visualized patches responsible for activations at higher layers, but the proposed visualizations in this paper provide top-down projections that reveal structures within each patch.

Point: Visualization of Feature Activations
Description: The deconvnet model is used to visualize feature activations on the ImageNet validation set.
Example 1: Feature visualizations show the top 9 activations and corresponding image patches, revealing the discriminant structures.
Example 2: Layer projections demonstrate the hierarchical nature of features, capturing corners, textures, and objects at different levels.
Point: Training Details
Description: Details of the large convnet model used for visualization are described.
Example 1: The model is trained on the ImageNet 2012 training set with preprocessing steps such as resizing, cropping, and sub-cropping.
Point: Convnet Visualization
Description: Visualization results of the trained model are presented.
Example 1: Feature visualizations show the progression of strongest activations during training, demonstrating convergence over epochs.
Example 2: Feature invariance to translations and scalings is observed, with some rotation invariance for objects with rotational symmetry.
Point: Architecture Selection
Description: Issues with the original architecture are identified, and improvements are made based on visualizations.
Example 1: The filter size and stride of convolutions are adjusted to retain more information and reduce aliasing artifacts.
Point: Occlusion Sensitivity
Description: The model's ability to localize objects within images is examined using occlusion.
Example 1: Occlusion of object regions results in a significant drop in the probability of the correct class, validating the model's localization capability.
Point: Correspondence Analysis
Description: The possibility of implicit computation of object part correspondence in deep models is explored.
Example 1: Systematically occluding the same part of dog images reveals consistency in the difference vectors between original and occluded images, suggesting implicit computation of part correspondence.
