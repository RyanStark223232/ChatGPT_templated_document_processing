Based on the content of the research paper, here is a summary in the requested format:
Point 1
Description: The minimum depth of the network is crucial for the model's performance, rather than any individual section.
Example 1: Conducting an ablation study on the model to determine the importance of minimum depth.
Example 2: Showing that a deep network with minimum depth outperforms models with shallow depth.
Point 2
Description: The ImageNet trained model demonstrates good generalization to other datasets.
Example 1: Beating the best reported results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.
Example 2: Questioning the utility of benchmarks with small training sets (<104) based on the achieved performance.
Point 3
Description: The convnet model's performance on the PASCAL dataset suggests a potential dataset bias.
Example 1: Despite no tuning for the task, the model achieved results within 3:2% of the best reported result.
Example 2: Speculating that using a different loss function allowing multiple objects per image could improve performance for object detection.
